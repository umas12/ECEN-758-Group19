### Abstract
The ever-changing field of machine learning applications presents researchers with ongoing problems in creating resilient models that can identify complex patterns in a variety of datasets. In-depth analysis of machine learning techniques is covered in this study, with a focus on how well they work with various fashion classification datasets. Knowing how flexible and effective these models are on broader datasets is crucial, as the fashion industry grows more and more data-driven. In this study, we describe our joint experience building and assessing machine learning models for the Fashion MNIST dataset. Above and beyond achieving maximum precision, we also tried to comprehend model interpretability, the effects of architectural decisions, and the wider ramifications for practical uses.
